### What is YouTrackDB?

YouTrackDB is an object-oriented graph database that supports documents, full-text search,
reactivity, and geospatial concepts.\
YouTrackDB has been supported and developed by [YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack)
project from JetBrains.

YouTrackDB's key features are:

1. **Fast data processing**: Links traversal is processed with O(1) complexity. There are no
   expensive run-time JOINs.
2. **Universal API**: Implements rich graph and object-oriented data models. Rich API is the same
   for all types of deployments (both embedded and server).
3. **SQL-like query language**: Uses a dialect of SQL query language enriched by graph and
   object-oriented functions and commands.
4. **Scalable development workflow**: YouTrackDB works in schema-less, schema-mixed, and schema-full
   modes. The universal API allows you to port your database to any supported deployment type with
   zero development efforts.
5. **Strong security**: A strong security profiling system based on user, role, and predicate
   security.
6. **Encryption of data at rest**: Optionally encrypts all data stored on disk.
7. **Binary compatibility with OrientDB**: Databases created with OrientDB can be used in
   YouTrackDB.

### Easy to install and use

YouTrackDB can run on any platform without configuration and installation.
The full Server distribution is a few MBs without the demo database.
